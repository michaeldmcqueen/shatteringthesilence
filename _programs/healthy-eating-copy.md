Balanced Well Being

We will be offering a smoothie-making station with 2-3 healthy <br>fruit/vegetable/protein smoothie options for the participants to make <br>and try to see which one they like best.  In addition, we will have <br>ingredients to make a quick and easy trail mix or granola concoction.  <br>We'll be discussing the connection between gut health and mental health <br>and how important certain nutrients are for keeping both our guts and <br>our brains happy!  Many teenagers are deficient in Vitamin D, Vitamin <br>B12 and omega 3 fatty acids and all of these deficiencies can cause <br>struggles with mood and overall health.
