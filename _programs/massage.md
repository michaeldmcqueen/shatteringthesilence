Receive a session of Access Bars to relax and let go of stress, anxiety and depression; experience a deeper peace within that allows you to be more present with yourself and others. At worst you feel like you had a great massage and at best, your life begins to change from letting go of limiting beliefs, thoughts and emotions. This is done using gently touch on points on the head.
