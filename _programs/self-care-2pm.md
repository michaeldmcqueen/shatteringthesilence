As we grow, develop and experience the world, we not only learn more and more of who we truly are, we also encounter many moments where both joy and suffering are present. Â Often we can be accustomed, programmed, conditioned or even expected to only focus on the joys and to suppress or hide the suffering. In this introduction to self-compassion, we will discuss the definitions of suffering and compassion, we will explore our common human experiences that unite us vs. divide us and hopefully find a place where we can appreciate both the joy and the suffering as useful tools and common experiences in our lives.
