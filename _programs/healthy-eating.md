Balanced Well Being

We will be offering a smoothie-making station with 2-3 healthy&nbsp;<br>fruit/vegetable/protein smoothie options for the participants to make&nbsp;<br>and try to see which one they like best.&nbsp; In addition, we will have&nbsp;<br>ingredients to make a quick and easy trail mix or granola concoction. &nbsp;<br>We'll be discussing the connection between gut health and mental health&nbsp;<br>and how important certain nutrients are for keeping both our guts and&nbsp;<br>our brains happy!&nbsp; Many teenagers are deficient in Vitamin D, Vitamin&nbsp;<br>B12 and omega 3 fatty acids and all of these deficiencies can cause&nbsp;<br>struggles with mood and overall health.
