In this brief, introductory class we'll discuss the important role that herbs play in nurturing our emotional and mental health as part of a self-care routine. Together we'll explore herbs as allies, which help us to cultivate a deeper relationship with ourselves and the world around us. We will be introduced to a few key herbal allies and participants will leave with a sample tea to continue cultivating a self-care practice around herbal medicine at home.
