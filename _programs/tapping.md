Regulating our nervous system helps us to respond to stress and anxiety in healthier ways. Staying "regulated" can help us come back into our bodies and become more grounded with the current moment. This session will include a fun nervous system regulation exercise and will end with a guided meditation called "Containment" to help maintain control over our bodies.
