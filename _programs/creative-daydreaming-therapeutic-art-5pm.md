Enter thru an artistic portal of a daydreamy, fun & healing art workshop, where you are the master of control. All abilities welcome. Youth will be led how to draw a neat piece, to also color. Youth will leave inspired with a handful of colorful sharpies & a rad art notebook! Marc is a local, cool, artist & civil rights social worker for important youth without homes, runaway or living in transition situations.
