Mosaics: Make a personal mosaic out of shattered glass pieces. Take the broken and make an art piece to take home.
 
Participants will take pieces of already broken pieces of glass and assemble them in whatever way they desire. They will use adhesive to glue pieces to a cork backing. Participants will be able to take their mosaic home with them once it is dry.

Love Notes: 
Watercolor postcards, perfect for creating a note for yourself or others, to share a little love in this world. 

Clothespin inspiration: Create small pieces of positivity to secretly attach to someone, so that when they find it it brings a smile to their face
