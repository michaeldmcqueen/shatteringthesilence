Do you like succulents? Create your own succulent mandala to take home! What IS a mandala? Mandala means circle and represents your relationship between the universe and your spirit. Planting a mandala enhances focus, combats anxiety and aids in your appreciation for the beauty of nature. Planting a mandala is &nbsp;fun and transformative!
